<p>#BadToGood</p>
<p>The key is B flat major.</p>
<p>The tempo is 144 bpm.</p>
<p>The context is that it's about having several bad days at once and how to recover from it. It's something I understand.</p>
<p>Key lyrics are: "A hundred bad days made a hundred good stories. A hundred good stories make me interesting at parties."</p>
